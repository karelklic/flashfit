== FlashFit 0.11
Released 2012-03-28.

- Previously, A0-Ainf data for every speed constant were displayed all
  together on single line. Now, the A0-Ainf data are properly
  separated by a newline character.
- Previously, loading a data file under Microsoft Windows might have
  failed because flashfit attempted to print debugging error messages
  to standard output during the conversion of voltage to absorbance.
  Now, no debugging error messages are printed, so files are loaded
  without issues.

== FlashFit 0.10
Released 2012-02-17.

- Initial support for luminiscence.

== FlashFit 0.9
Released 2012-01-22.

- Previously, Flashfit was able to open only comma-separated CSV
  files, but not the tab-separated CSV files. The file reading routine
  has been extended to handle both comma-separated and tab-separated
  files for this version.
- `make install` properly installs helper script to execute Python
  code to bindir.

== FlashFit 0.8
Released 2011-10-05.

- Long-running calculations can be terminated by pressing ESC key.

== FlashFit 0.7
Released 2011-01-29.

- Improved and extended settings. The Appearance Dialog was splitted
  into multiple smaller and more detailed dialogs.

== FlashFit 0.6
Released 2010-06-08.

- Fixed link in Start menu in Microsoft Windows.
- Autotools used for automating tasks such as releasing new versions.
- Fixed a regression from FlashFit 0.5 in TimeBarPair.

== FlashFit 0.5
Released 2010-06-07.

- Works again on Microsoft Windows.
- Experimental method allows parameter fixing and setting
  initial parameter values.

== FlashFit 0.4
Released 2010-06-03.

- Fixes in both fitting algorithms (now both new and old/compatible
  algorithms provide same results).
- Compatible algorithm allows parameter fixing, first/second
  order parameters, setting startup parameter value.
- Fixed precision calculation (sigma) in compat algorithm.
- Ainf, A0-AInf(x) are calculated and displayed to user.
- A0 is calculated from the the fitting curve, not read from input data.
- New appearance dialog.
- Fitting messages appear in Console.

== FlashFit 0.3
Released 2010-03-22.

- Information table can be moved by mouse.
- The precision of rate constants can be set.
- Ask before overwriting image file when exporting.
- Better naming of fitting models.
- Test file generators get_ab_cd, gen_abc, gen_ab.

== FlashFit 0.2
Released 2010-02-01.

- Includes alternative fitting algorithm.
- The work area is not resized when the point count is changed.
- Information table and its parts can be hidden.
- Added a rectangle around the information table.
- File creation date, file name, A0 is included in the information table.
- Massive speed optimizations.
- Fitting is no longer automatic, the data are fitted on button click.
- Background tasks for file loading, point count changes, and fitting.
- Added a status bar displaying progress data.
- Improved image export (PNG resolution)

== FlashFit 0.1
